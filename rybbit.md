## Privacy positioning

Rybbit has largely the same privacy positioning as other privacy friendly GA alternatives like plausible, simpleanalytics, and fathom. It identifies users with useragent+IP hash and has a daily rotating salt that can be turned on. We mention it, but our marketing is a lot less reliant on it. This is because being explicity privacy focused limits the types of features we can add in the future.

## General positioning

Web analytics is quite crowded. One one side you have complex enterprise platforms like GA, posthog, statsig, mixpanel, amplitude. And on the other side you have simple privacy friendly alternatives like plausible, umami, fathom.

Rybbit basically tries to fill a gap in between the two - much easier to use than enterprise platforms but more powerful than the simple privacy focused ones. It's probably still closer to the latter group since our product analytics capabilities are nowhere near that of mixpanel or amplitude yet.

Rybbit has a lot of features, but none of them are super complicated which means everything mostly works out of the box. The upside is that there is no friction to use features, but the downside is that for some people with advanced product analytics requirements rybbit is not configurable enough. Currently there are no support for custom dashboards or a/b testing.

So our target audience is basically is people who would plausible/umami/GA/cloudflare for general tracking as well as people that probably won't go through the trouble of setting up complex product analytics workflows on mixppanel or amplitude.

## Strengths and weaknesses

- probably the prettiest UI of all these platforms. this is definitely the best part about rybbit
- has far more features than plausibe/umami/fathom/simpleanalytics without being any harder to use
- depth of features is lower than full fledged enterprise product analytics platforms
- much easiser to self host than posthog or sentry, but probably a bit harder to self host than umami or plausible
- default script size is 18kb unzipped which is bigger than privacy friendly platforms, but sitll a lot smaller than GA
- no way to import data from other platforms yet
- should be a lot less prone to adblockers
- boostrapped by solofounder (could be strength or weakness)
- no whitelabeling or theming yet
- open source and self-hostable
- very modern (launched in early 2025)
- has live demo on real data
