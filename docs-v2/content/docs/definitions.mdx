## Aggregate Metrics

### Unique Users
The total number of distinct individuals who visited your website, identified by a unique user ID. Each user is counted only once regardless of how many times they visit.

### Sessions
A series of user interactions with your website within a given time frame. A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity from the same user ID. Multiple pageviews can occur within one session.

### Pageviews
The total number of times visitors have viewed pages on your website. Each time a page is loaded or reloaded counts as a pageview.

### Pages Per Session
The average number of pages viewed during a session. Calculated by dividing the total number of pageviews by the total number of sessions.

### Bounce Rate
The percentage of sessions where a user leaves your site after viewing only one page without any interaction. A high bounce rate might indicate that landing pages aren't relevant to visitors.

### Session Duration
The average length of time users spend on your site during a session. Longer sessions typically indicate more engaged visitors.
