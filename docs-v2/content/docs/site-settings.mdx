## Public Analytics

You can make your analytics public by enabling the "Public Analytics" option in your site settings. Once enabled, you can share the page link with anyone.

- External viewers will not be able to edit any of your settings or add/remove/edit any existing reports, funnels, or goals
- Your other websites will not be affected
- Viewers have read-only access to your analytics data

## Enhanced Privacy (User ID Salting)

Rybbit stores user IDs as a hashed combination of IP + user agent. This allows us to identify users across many sessions on the same device, but can be seen as storing personally identifiable data under GDPR.

You can enable enhanced privacy by turning on the "User ID Salting" option in your site settings.

When enabled, Rybbit will forget about unique users every day. If a user visits your site 10 times in one day, Rybbit will count that as one user with 10 sessions. But if they visit once a day for 10 days, they will be seen as a new user every day.

### Downsides of enabling user ID salting:

- You will no longer see user session history beyond 24 hours
- Unique user count over a period longer than 24 hours will be inflated
- The user retention page will effectively be useless

## Changing Domains

You can update the domain of your site directly from the settings page.

- Changing domains will not affect any existing data
- All historical analytics will be preserved
- Currently we only support one domain per site

## Deleting Sites

You can permanently delete a site by clicking the "Delete Site" button in the settings page.

<Callout type="warn">
  This action will delete all data associated with the site and cannot be undone.
