## Decision

2025-05-31 13:49:52 - Memory Bank Architecture Implementation

## Rationale

Implemented a comprehensive Memory Bank system to maintain project context across different modes and sessions. This decision was made to:

- Ensure continuity of project understanding across different development sessions
- Provide a centralized location for tracking architectural decisions and progress
- Enable better collaboration and knowledge transfer
- Support the complex, multi-component architecture of Rybbit Analytics

## Implementation Details

- Created five core Memory Bank files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, and systemPatterns.md
- Established initial project context based on projectBrief.md
- Set up tracking mechanisms for ongoing development activities
- Prepared framework for documenting future architectural decisions and patterns
