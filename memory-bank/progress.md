2025-06-01 11:40:32 - Added skeleton loading state to SiteSelector component

- Implemented conditional rendering for loading state when site data is falsy
- Created skeleton with matching dimensions and styling
- Added pulse animation for better UX during data fetching

2025-06-01 11:42:55 - Added skeleton loading state to SiteSelectorContent dropdown items

- Implemented conditional rendering for loading state when sites data is falsy
- Created 3 skeleton dropdown items with matching structure and styling
- Added pulse animation and prevented interactions during loading state

2025-06-01 13:13:52 - Optimized getSitesFromOrg authorization checks for concurrent execution

- Converted sequential admin and member checks to run concurrently using Promise.all()
- Simplified conditional logic while maintaining same authorization behavior
- Improved performance by reducing total execution time for authorization

2025-06-01 13:14:48 - Further optimized getSitesFromOrg by adding sites query to concurrent execution

- Extended Promise.all to include sites data query alongside authorization checks
- Now runs admin check, member check, and sites query all concurrently
- Additional performance improvement by eliminating sequential sites data fetch

2025-06-01 13:16:19 - Completed full optimization of getSitesFromOrg with all 5 database operations concurrent

- Added organization owner query and organization info query to Promise.all
- Removed duplicate sequential queries that were previously executed separately
- Now runs admin check, member check, sites query, owner query, and org info query all concurrently
- Maximum performance optimization achieved - reduced from 5 sequential to 1 concurrent operation

2025-06-06 21:28:35 - Enhanced normalizeOrigin function to remove all subdomain prefixes

- Modified normalizeOrigin function in server/src/utils.ts to handle all subdomains, not just "www"
- Added support for IP addresses and localhost (returned as-is)
- Implemented logic for multi-level TLDs (e.g., .co.uk, .com.au)
- Function now extracts the root domain from any subdomain structure
- Examples: api.example.com → example.com, subdomain.site.co.uk → site.co.uk

2025-06-06 21:29:55 - Updated domain normalization in trackEvent.ts validateOrigin function

- Imported normalizeOrigin function from utils.ts into trackEvent.ts
- Replaced manual www. prefix removal with enhanced normalizeOrigin function
- Now uses consistent subdomain removal logic across both origin and site domain validation
- Ensures proper domain matching for sites with subdomains in tracking validation

2025-06-06 21:33:45 - Improved normalizeOrigin function with Public Suffix List and better input handling

- Added psl (Public Suffix List) dependency for reliable multi-level TLD detection
- Removed unnecessary URL parsing when input is already a hostname
- Function now accepts both URLs and hostnames as input
- Uses PSL to accurately determine registrable domains (handles all TLDs correctly)
- Added robust fallback logic for edge cases
- Eliminates hardcoded TLD list that was incomplete and unreliable
