You can integrate Rybbit into your WordPress site to track user behavior and gather analytics. There are several ways to do this depending on whether you're using a hosted WordPress.com site or a self-hosted WordPress.org installation.

    **Rybbit WordPress Plugin (Recommended for ease of use)**

    You can find our community-maintained WordPress plugin as well as installation instructions [here](https://github.com/didyouexpectthat/rybbit-analytics-tracking-code). This is often the simplest method for most users.

    **Insert Headers and Footers Plugin (Good for WordPress.com or no-code approach)**

    If you don't want to modify your theme files directly, or if you are using WordPress.com (where direct theme editing is restricted), you can use a plugin to inject the Rybbit snippet.

    1. Install the [Insert Headers and Footers](https://wordpress.com/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers) plugin (or a similar plugin that allows adding scripts to the header).
    2. Go to the plugin settings (often found under **Settings > Insert Headers and Footers**).
    3. Paste your Rybbit tracking snippet into the section designated for scripts in the header.
       ```html
       <script
         src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
         data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
         async
         defer
       ></script>
       ```
    4. Save your changes.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Add to `functions.php` (For self-hosted WordPress with child theme)**

    If you're using a self-hosted WordPress theme, you can add the script via `functions.php`. It is **strongly recommended to make these changes in a child theme**. If you modify the parent theme files directly, your changes may be lost when the theme is updated.

    1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance > Theme File Editor**. (Alternatively, edit the file via FTP/SFTP or your hosting file manager, which is safer if you are unfamiliar with editing theme files directly).
    2. Open your child theme's `functions.php` file (or your parent theme's `functions.php` if you are not using a child theme, with the above caution in mind).
    3. Add the following code to the end of the file:
       ```php
       function add_rybbit_script_to_head() {
         ?>
         <script
           src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
           data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID" // Replace YOUR_SITE_ID with your actual Site ID
           async
           defer
         ></script>
         <?php
       }
       add_action('wp_head', 'add_rybbit_script_to_head');
       ```
    4. Save the file. Ensure you replace `"YOUR_SITE_ID"` with your actual Rybbit Site ID.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Modify `header.php` (For self-hosted WordPress with child theme, less common)**

    You can also manually add the script to your theme's HTML header. This method is generally less preferred than using `functions.php` but is an option. It is **strongly recommended to make these changes in a child theme**. If you modify the parent theme files directly, your changes may be lost when the theme is updated.

    1. Go to **Appearance > Theme File Editor**. (Alternatively, edit the file via FTP/SFTP or your hosting file manager, which is safer if you are unfamiliar with editing theme files directly).
    2. Open your child theme's `header.php` file (or your parent theme's `header.php` if you are not using a child theme, with the above caution in mind).
    3. Paste your Rybbit tracking snippet right before the closing `</head>` tag:
       ```html
       <script
         src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
         data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID" <!-- Replace YOUR_SITE_ID with your actual Site ID -->
         async
         defer
       ></script>
       ```
    4. Save the file. Ensure you replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Rybbit Site ID.
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Remember to replace `"YOUR_SITE_ID"` in the snippets with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.
