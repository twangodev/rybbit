# Squarespace

Integrating Rybbit Analytics with your Squarespace website is straightforward. You'll need to use Squarespace's "Code Injection" feature to add the Rybbit tracking script to your site.

## 1. Get Your Tracking Script

First, you'll need your Rybbit tracking script. You can find this in your Rybbit dashboard under **Site Settings > Tracking Code**. It will look something like this:

```html
<script async defer src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.

## 2. Go to Squarespace Settings

Log in to your Squarespace account and go to the website you want to track.

From the main dashboard (Home Menu), navigate to:

- **Settings**

## 3. Access Code Injection

In the Settings panel, find and click on:

- **Website** (under the "GENERAL" section)
- Then, click on **Code Injection** (under the "ADVANCED" or "DEVELOPER" section, depending on your Squarespace version).

<Callout type="info">
  The Code Injection feature is available on Squarespace Business and Commerce plans. It may not be available on Personal plans.
</Callout>

## 4. Paste Your Tracking Script

In the Code Injection settings, you'll see several fields (Header, Footer, Lock Page, Order Confirmation Page).

For sitewide tracking, paste your Rybbit tracking script into the **Footer** text area. This ensures the script loads after your page content, which is generally better for perceived page load performance.

Alternatively, you can place it in the **Header**, which might track users who leave before the page fully loads, but could slightly impact initial page load speed. For most analytics purposes, the Footer is recommended.

## 5. Save Changes

After pasting the script, click the **Save** button at the top of the Code Injection panel.

## 6. Verify Integration

Once you've saved the changes, Rybbit Analytics should start tracking visitors on your Squarespace site.

- Open your Squarespace website in a new browser tab or incognito window.
- Navigate through a few pages.
- Check your Rybbit dashboard for incoming data. It might take a few minutes for the first events to appear.

That's it! Rybbit Analytics is now integrated with your Squarespace website.
