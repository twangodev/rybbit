# React (Vite / CRA)

This guide explains how to integrate Rybbit with your client-side React application, such as those created with Create React App (CRA) or Vite.

## How to Add Rybbit to Your React App

The recommended and simplest method to add the Rybbit tracking script is directly in your `index.html` file. This ensures the script is loaded early and reliably.

### Adding to `public/index.html` (or `index.html` for Vite)

This is the most straightforward method and ensures the script is loaded early.

<Steps>
### 1. Retrieve Your Tracking Script

Navigate to your Rybbit dashboard to obtain your code snippet. It will look like this:

```html
<script
  src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
  data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
  async
  defer
></script>
```
Remember to replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID.

### 2. Locate Your `index.html` File

-   For **Create React App (CRA)**: This file is typically located at `public/index.html`.
-   For **Vite (React template)**: This file is typically located at the root of your project as `index.html`.

### 3. Add the Snippet to `index.html`

Open your `index.html` file and paste the Rybbit tracking snippet just before the closing `</head>` tag or `</body>` tag. Placing it in the `<head>` allows it to load sooner.

```html filename="public/index.html (CRA) or index.html (Vite)"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" /> <!-- Example for CRA -->
    <!-- Other meta tags and links -->
    <title>My React App</title>
    <!-- Rybbit Tracking Snippet -->
    <script
      src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
      data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
      async
      defer
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!-- If you prefer, you can also place the script here, before </body> -->
  </body>
</html>
```
Make sure to replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID.

### 4. Verify Installation

After deploying your application, open your Rybbit dashboard to see if data is being received. You can also check your browser's network tab to ensure `script.js` is loaded.
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **SPA Page View Tracking**: Rybbit's tracking script is designed to automatically detect route changes in most modern SPAs (including those using React Router or similar libraries) and track them as page views. If you find that page views are not being tracked correctly after navigation, you might need to manually trigger page views using `window.rybbit.trackPageview()` after each route change. However, try the standard installation first.
</Callout>

## Custom Event Tracking

Once the script is installed, you can track custom events from any of your React components:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    if (window.rybbit) {
      window.rybbit.trackEvent('button_click', { category: 'CTA', label: 'Learn More' });
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Learn More</button>;
}
```

Ensure `window.rybbit` is available before calling its methods, especially if you load the script dynamically or have strict Content Security Policies.
